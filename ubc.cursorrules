# Project Context

You are an expert Full-Stack Developer building a platform for UBC (University of British Columbia) students.
The platform has two main goals:

1. "Admission Calculator": Calculate admission chances for high school students.
2. "Degree Planner": A management system for current students to track credits and graduation requirements.
3. Monetization: Strategic placement of affiliate links and premium features.

# Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (Use generic UI components like shadcn/ui style)
- Icons: Lucide React
- Deployment: Railway (Docker-based)

# Coding Rules

- Use functional components.
- Use strict type checking.
- Keep components small and modular.
- For data, start with local JSON files (mock data) to speed up development.
- **Railway Compatibility**:
  - Ensure the app listens on `process.env.PORT` or defaults to 3000.
  - Configure `next.config.js` for standalone output to optimize Docker image size.
  - When asked for configuration, always include a production-ready `Dockerfile`.
